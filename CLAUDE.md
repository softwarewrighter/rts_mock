# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a web-based Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game UI mockup built with Rust and WebAssembly. It's a demonstration project showcasing a classic RTS interface without actual game logic - purely a UI prototype with interactive elements.

## Common Development Commands

### Build the project
```bash
wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir pkg
```

### Code quality checks
```bash
# Linting
cargo clippy

# Formatting
cargo fmt

# Run tests (though no tests are currently implemented)
cargo test
```

### Development workflow
1. Make changes to Rust code in `src/lib.rs`
2. Build with `wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir pkg`
3. Serve the project with any HTTP server (e.g., `python -m http.server 8000`)
4. Access `index.html` in the browser

## Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Rust** with `wasm-bindgen` for WebAssembly compilation
- **web-sys** for browser API access
- **HTML5/CSS3** with all styling inline in `index.html`
- **SVG** for map and minimap graphics
- Minimal JavaScript for WASM initialization

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Clean Separation**: 
   - Rust handles all interaction logic (`src/lib.rs`)
   - HTML/CSS provides complete UI layout (all in `index.html`)
   - JavaScript is minimal glue code for WASM/DOM bridging

2. **UI Component Structure**:
   - Resource Panel (top bar)
   - Main Map (SVG-based interactive area)
   - Minimap (overview with viewport)
   - Build Menu (8 building types)
   - Research Menu (7 technologies)
   - Unit Controls (movement commands)

3. **Interaction Model**:
   - All clicks handled by Rust functions exposed via `#[wasm_bindgen]`
   - Status messages displayed both in console and on-screen
   - No state management - purely demonstrative responses

### Important Files
- `src/lib.rs`: Main WASM module with all interaction handlers
- `index.html`: Complete UI with inline CSS and JavaScript initialization
- `pkg/`: Generated directory containing WASM binary and JS bindings (after build)

### Development Tips
- The project uses a retro terminal aesthetic (green-on-black theme)
- All styling is inline in `index.html` - no separate CSS files
- The `pkg/` directory is auto-generated by `wasm-pack` and should not be edited manually
- When adding new interactive elements, expose them through `#[wasm_bindgen]` functions in `lib.rs`
